<!-- Explaintion

    
This JavaScript code defines two classes: `Animal` and `Dog`.
 The `Animal` class has a constructor that takes a `name` parameter and a method `speak()` that logs a generic noise message.
  The `Dog` class extends `Animal` and overrides the `speak()` method with a specific bark message.
   Finally, an instance of `Dog` named `Buddy` is created, and its `speak()` method is called, resulting in "Buddy barks."
    being logged to the console. -->
