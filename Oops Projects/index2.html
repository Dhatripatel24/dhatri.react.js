<!-- 
    
    Explaition

- The `Vehicle` class has a constructor that takes `make` and `model` parameters and a method `getInfo()` that returns a string containing the make and model.

- The `Car` class extends `Vehicle` and adds a `year` property. It overrides the `getInfo()` method to include the year in the returned string by calling `super.getInfo()` to get the make and model information.

An instance of `Car` named `myCar` is created with the make 'Toyota', model 'Camry', and year 2020. Then, `console.log(myCar.getInfo())` prints the information about the car, including the make, model, and year. -->
